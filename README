DESCRIPTION:
	This plugin detects DDoS attacks and displays the result for each timeslot.
	several indices are counted for each timeslot data and are saved in
	the database. such as: total bytes sent and received during each timeslot,
	total packets, number of similar packets (two packets are assumed similar
	if they are of the same size) and the percentage of the most often 
	repeated packet.
	DDoS is detected if the following two conditions are met:
	    1. total bytes in this flow are greater than the average number
	        of total bytes during last $interval period **times** some coefficient.
	    2. percentage of similar packets in this flow is greater than the
	        average number of such percentage during last $interval period
		**PLUS** some coefficient;
		if either of the above two conditions are not met, no DDoS is detected;
			    
	This is mostly the testing release, so these coefficients may be
	changed according to your needs. see ($INTERVAL, $PERCENTAGE_COEFFICIENT
	and BYTE_COEFFICIENT) in gabriel.pm.
	Increase $INTERVAL if you want to consider older flows when detecting DDoS.
	Increase $PERCENTAGE_COEFFICIENT and $BYTE_COEFFICIENT if a normal flow is 
	detected as an attack, or decrease them if some attacks are not detected.
  
	in the case of bugs, misbehaviour, problems or ideas, write at
	cert@dea.gov.ge


INSTALLATION:
	1) Create a MySQL database, according to gabriel.sql file.

	2) Copy the Backend files into $BACKEND_PLUGINDIR and frontend files into $FRONTEND_PLUGINDIR
	
	3) Open the gabriel.pm file and set $DB_USER and $DB_PASS to your DB username and password.

	4) Read the overall description on top of this file, because you may need to change
	$INTERVAL, $PERCENTAGE_COEFFICIENT and $BYTE_COEFFICIENT too (in gabriel.pm), depending on your needs.

	make sure, when running the plugin for the first time (when database is empty), there is no
	ongoing DDoS attack, because, it won't be detected as an attack and will be assumed as the
	normal flow. which may cause that later attacks go undetected too.


Remember, this is a testing release only. Don't depend on it too much. if you detect some 
misbehaviour, or have some ideas how to improve this plugin, don't hesitate to write us at cert@dea.gov.ge
